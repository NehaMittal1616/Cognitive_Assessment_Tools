Cognitive Assessment Tools
This repository contains a collection of web-based tools for assessing and detecting cognitive disorders such as dementia, Alzheimer's disease, and autism. These tools were developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create interactive and accessible cognitive tests that can be performed remotely.

Tools Included
The following cognitive assessment tools are part of this project:

1) ASDetect
A tool designed for detecting autism spectrum disorder (ASD) based on specific behavioral traits.

2) Alphabet Tracing
An interactive tool where users trace letters to assess motor control and cognitive function.

3) Face-Name Association Test
This test measures the ability to associate names with faces, which is an important cognitive function often impacted in Alzheimer's disease.

4) McLean Screening Instrument for BPD (MSI-BPD)
A screening tool for borderline personality disorder (BPD), assessing emotional and behavioral symptoms.

5) Memory Test
A simple memory test that challenges users to recall information after a short period.

5) Mental Rotation Test
This test assesses spatial reasoning by asking users to mentally rotate objects.

6) Paired Associate Learning Test
A learning test where users are asked to memorize and recall associated pairs of items.

6) Test of Pragmatic Language (TOPL)
This test evaluates the user's pragmatic language skills, important for social communication and cognitive development.

7) Shape Recognition
Users trace and recognize shapes, helping assess visual-spatial skills and motor coordination.

Technologies Used
HTML for structuring the content and layout of the tests.
CSS for designing the user interface, ensuring the tests are visually engaging and accessible.
JavaScript for adding interactivity, real-time feedback, and logic to the tests.
Purpose
These tools are aimed at providing an accessible platform for detecting cognitive impairments. By using simple web technologies, these tests can be administered remotely, allowing for early detection of cognitive issues from the comfort of oneâ€™s home. The tests simulate real-world cognitive assessments and are inspired by tools used by healthcare professionals.


How to Use
1) Clone this repository to your local machine:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
2) Open any of the HTML files in a browser to start using the tools.

Each tool is self-contained and can be run independently from the others.
